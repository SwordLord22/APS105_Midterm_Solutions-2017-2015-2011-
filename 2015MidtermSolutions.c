  * Solutions to question 1 to 9: 
  * 1) Answer: D will be printed 150 times
           
            #include <stdio.h> 
            #include <stdlib.h>
            
            int main(void) 
            { 
                int i = 300, count = 0;
                while (i > 0) // Excluding 0. 
                 { 
                   if (i % 2 == 0) // There will only be 150 even numbers in the range of 300. 
                   {
                        printf("D"); 
                        count++;
                   }
                   i--; 
                 }
                printf("\n%d", count);
                return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
            }

  * 2) double distance = (averageSpeed * (1/1000)) * 1800;    
  * 3) int randomGuess = 2*((rand() % (UPPER_BOUND - LOWER_BOUND + 1)) + LOWER_BOUND) + 1;
  * 4) bool yellow = (red && green && !blue)
  * 5) int leftover = fmin(numApples % 3, numApples % 5);
  * 6) There are four errors in this program: 

            #include <stdio.h> 
            #include <math.h> 
             
            int main(void) 
            { 
                 double root; 
                 for (int number = 1; number < 101; number += 2) // ERROR 1
                  { 
                       number = sqrt((double) root); // ERROR 2
                       printf("The Square Root of %0.2f is %.1f\n", number, root); // ERROR 3
                    } 
                 return (EXIT_DENIED); // ERROR 4
             }
            
             ERROR 1 => Should be written as for(number = 1.0; number <= 101.0; number += 2.0). This is logical error. 
                                     The variable number declaration should be declared outside the for loop as to not give run-time error due to conflicting C standards!
             ERROR 2 =>  Should be written as root = sqrt(number); This is a syntax error. 
             ERROR 3 =>  Should be written as printf("The square root of %lf is %0.2lf\n", number, root); This is a syntax error. 
             ERROR 4 =>  This cannot be used in this program, because it needs the <stdlib.h> library to work. 
                                      Without it, it will give a compile-time error. This is considered to be a logical error. 

  * 7) The output of this program is DEBUG

          Remember that A is 65 and Z is 90 in ASCII.
          Also remember that a is 97 and z is 122 in ASCII. 
  
            #include <stdio.h> 
            #include <stdlib.h>
            
            int main(void) { 
                char firstChar = 'A'; 
                char secondChar = 'U';
                printf("%c", firstChar + 3); // 65 + 3 = 68 = D
                firstChar += 4; // 65 + 4 = 69 = E
                printf("%c", firstChar); // E
                printf("%c", firstChar - 3); // 69 - 3 = 66 = B
                printf("%c", secondChar); // U
                firstChar++; // 69 + 1 = 70 = F
                firstChar++; // 70 + 1 = 71 = G
                printf("%c\n", firstChar); // G
                return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
            }

  * 8) Ouput for this program is below!
        
          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <stdlib.h>
         
           int main(void) 
           { 
             int i, j, k;
             for (i = 10; i <= 14; i = i + 2) // 10, 12, 14
                { 
                   for (j = 5; j > 0; j--) // 5, 4, 3, 2,1
                    { 
                         k = i + j; 
                         printf("%d ", k); 
                    } 
                }
             return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }
        
           The output for this program is 15 14 13 12 11 17 16 15 14 13 19 18 17 16 15

      We have to write program that will prompt the user to input a character.

      Remember that in ASCII a is 97 and z is 122.
      Remember that in ASCII 0 is 48 and 9 is 57. 
      Remember that any other character beside those stated above would be considered special characters!

      We have to create a program that will reverse a given number (1234 would become 4321 when reversed).
      We would need to use the formula sum = sum * 10 + num; to get the reversed value of the given number. 
      This will be calculated via a while loop with the condition that the given number is not equal 0.  
    
       #include <stdio.h>
          
        int reverseDigits(int value)
        {
            int num = 0, sum = 0; 
            while(value != 0)
            {
                num = value % 10; 
                sum = sum * 10 + num; // 4321
                value /= 10; 
            }
            return sum; 
        }
          
        int main(void)

    We want to create a program to calculate the arctan(x) without using the artan() function in the math.h library!
    For this, we will need a function to calculate the arctan. We will also need a for loop to loop through 0 to 301.
    These values are our loop starting and ending point. Moreover, these values increment by 2 each time.
