Question 9 [12 Marks]
There are 0.3048 metres in a foot, 100 centimetres in a metre, and 12 inches in a foot. Write a
program that will accept, as input, a length in feet and inches. You do not have to check for valid
inputâ€”assume the user enters positive, non-fractional values for the feet and inches. The program
will output the equivalent length in metres and centimetres (rounded to the nearest centimetre).

Your code should include four functions: one for input, one for output, one to perform the calculation, and main. 
The function prototypes are below. For full marks, your code should not use any global variables.

void getInput(int *outFeet, int *outInches);
void printOutput(int feet, int inches, int metres, int centimetres);
void convert(int feet, int inches, int *outMetres, int *outCentimetres);

An example of one run of the program is below:

Please enter the feet and inches to convert: 5 10
5 feet 10 inches is 1 metres and 78 centimetres.

Solution: 

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <math.h>

const double metresFoot = 0.3048;
const int centimetresMetres = 100; 
const double inchesFoot = 12; 

void getInput(int *outFeet, int *outInches)
{
  printf("Please enter the feet and inches to convert: ");
  scanf("%d %d", outFeet, outInches); 
}

void convert(int feet, int inches, int *outMetres, int *outCentimetres)
{
    double metres = (feet + (inches / inchesFoot)) * metresFoot;
    *outMetres = metres; 
    *outCentimetres = round((metres - *outMetres) * centimetresMetres); 
}

void printOutput(int feet, int inches, int metres, int centimetres)
{
  printf("%d feet %d inches is %d metres and %d centimetres.", feet, inches, metres, centimetres);
}

int main(void)
{
  int feet, inches, centimetres, metres;
  getInput(&feet, &inches);
  convert(feet, inches, &metres, &centimetres);
  printOutput(feet, inches, metres, centimetres);
  return 0; 
}
