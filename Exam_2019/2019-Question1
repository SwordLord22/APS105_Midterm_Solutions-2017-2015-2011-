Question 1 [4 Marks]
Write a single C statement — which contains exactly one terminating semi-colon (‘;’), and does
not contain brace brackets (‘{’ or ‘}’) — that evaluates one answer x for the Quadratic equation.
The formula is:

                                  x = (−b +√(b^2 − 4ac))/(2a)

Assume that all variables (i.e., x, a, b, and c) have already been declared as doubles. You can
assume all of the C math library functions are available. Write your solution in the box below.

Solution: 

x = ((-1)*(b)+sqrt((b*b)-4*a*c))/(2*a);
