Question 4 [4 Marks]
If you try to compile the code below, it will generate errors/warnings. Identify the line (line
numbers are shown on the left) where an error would occur, and write the code that would fix it.

1 #include <stdio.h>
2
3 void requestAge(int *age) {
4   do {
5     printf("Please enter your age as a positive integer.\n");
6     scanf("%d", &age);
7   } while(*age <= 0);
8 }
9
10 int main(void) {
11   printf("How old are you?\n");
12   int age;
13   requestAge(age);
14
15   printf("Wow, you're %d years old!\n", *age);
16   return 0
17 }

Solution: 

Line 16 => ERROR, missing ; at the of return 0. Should be written as return 0; 
Line 13 => ERROR, value of age that needs to be passed to the function has to be an address (as parameter of the function only contains a pointer). 
           Should be written as requestAge(&age); 
Line 15 => ERROR, trying to dereference a integer (makes no sense). Should be written as printf("Wow, you're %d years old\n", age); 
Line 6  => ERROR, address of pointer in scanf (makes no sense). Should be written as scanf("%d", age);
