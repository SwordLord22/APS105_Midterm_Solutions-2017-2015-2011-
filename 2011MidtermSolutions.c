  * Solutions to question 1 to 10: 
  * 1) bool myBool = (myInt % 2 == 0);
  * 2) const double PHI = ((sqrt(5) - 1) / (2));
  * 3) 
            Remember associtivity of arithmetic operators in C goes from LEFT to RIGHT!
            
            double a = 23.0, b = 20.0, c = 15.0, d = 8.0, e = 40.0;
            (int) (a + b / (c - 5.0)) / ((d + 7.0) / (e - 37.0) / 2.0)
             
             Now this becomes: 
             
            (int) ((a + b / 10.0) / ((15.0) / (3.0) / (2.0)))
            (int) ((23 + 2) / (15.0 / (3.0) / (2.0)))
            (int) ((25.0) / (2.5))
            (int) ((10))
            (10) <= This is our ANSWER!
             
            Test this out through this: 
            
              #include <stdio.h> 
  
              int main()
              {
                int result = 0; 
                double a = 23.0, b = 20.0, c = 15.0, d = 8.0, e = 40.0;
                result = (int) (a + b / (c - 5.0)) / ((d + 7.0) / (e - 37.0) / 2.0);
                printf("%d", result);
              }

  * 4)  
           Question states that given the values of i = 5, j = 0 and k = false, find if these expression are true or false!
           
           ((i >= 3) && (j == (int) 0.0))                                  => True
           (((i != 3) || (j != 4)) == !((i == 3) && (j == 4))      =>  True
           !((i-4) <= 0 )                                                           =>  True
           (k && (sin(42.0) == 0.1372))                               =>   False

  * 5) int lotto = (rand() % (649-601+1))+601; // int lotto = (rand() % (UPPER-LOWER+1)) + LOWER;
  * 6) 
          Question states that given this program, what would be its output...
           
            According to ASCII table (you should these values by heart as they are most used!):
            We know that capital A is equal to 65 and Z is 90...
            We also know that lowercase a is equal 97 and z is 122...
            We also know that digit 0 is 48 and digit 9 is 57...
           
           int main (void) 
           { 
                int i; 
                for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) // 0,1,2,3,4
                    printf("%c", ’a’+i); 
                    //This will print the following values and their corresponding letters!
                    // 65 + 0 = 65 = A
                    // 65 + 1 = 66 = B
                    // 65 + 2 = 67 = C
                    // 65 + 3 = 68 = D
                    // 65 + 4 = 69 = E
                return 0;
            }
            
            Thus it will print this: ABCDE
  * 7)
            Question states what would be output from this program...
            
            #include <stdio.h>
             
            int main (void) 
            { 
                 int a = 1; 
                 int b = 2;
                 while (a <= 45) {
                    printf("%d\n", a);
                    a += b; 
                    b++; 
                 }
                 return 0;
             }
            
             This what would be outputed from the program in each iteration (only 'a' values will be outputted to the user): 
              a = 1, b = 3
              a = 3, b = 4
              a = 6, b = 5
              a = 10, b = 6
              a = 15, b = 7
              a = 21, b = 8
              a = 28, b = 9
              a = 36, b = 10
              a = 45, b = 11
        
  * 8)
            Question states to find the output of the given C program....
             
            #include <stdio.h>
            
            int main (void) 
            { 
              int row, col; 
              for (row = 1; row <= 5; row++)  // 1,2,3,4,5
              { 
                    for (col = 1; col <= 9; col++) // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
                    { 
                        if ((col > row) && (col <= (9-row))) 
                            printf(" "); 
                        else 
                            printf("*"); 
                     } 
                 printf("\n"); 
                }
             return 0;
            }
            
            This program will print this pattern ( _ represents the spaces!): 
             
               *_______*        //  7 spaces
               **_____**        //  5 spaces
               ***___***        //  3 spaces
               ****_****        //  1 spaces
               *********        //  0 spaces

  * 9 - a) Solution: It will print 45 times!
  
                #include <stdio.h>
                
                int main(void)
                 {
                    int j = 0, i = 0, count = 0; 
                    for (i=0; i < 10; i++) // 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
                     {
                        for (j=0; j < 10; j++) // 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
                         {
                            if (i < j) 
                            {
                                printf("Chicken\n"); 
                                count++; // 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45. 9 times printed in first iteration and 1 printed in the second last iteration. 
                            }

                    printf("%d", count); 
                }

  * 9 - B) Solution: 9801 times!

        A while loop would be needed for this program as there is requirements regarding the inputs of the user.

        A counter needs to be use to keep track of the array index and its size.
