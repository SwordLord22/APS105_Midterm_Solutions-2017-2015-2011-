Question 8 [12 Marks]
If you have a certain number of US dollars and wish to convert them to Canadian dollars, you
could use the Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate (for example: 1 Canadian dollar = 0.75
US dollar). Write a complete C program that prompts its user for the current Canadian dollar to
US dollar exchange rate (e.g. 0.75) and a value in US dollars, and then prints the value in Canadian
dollars, rounding to the nearest hundredth. Your program will print the value with 6 digits after
the decimal point. Assume the user provides a valid exchange rate and US dollar amount.

Here is an example run of your program:

Enter the exchange rate (1 CAD = ? USD): 0.75
Enter the value in US dollars: 56
The value in Canadian dollars is 74.670000.

Solution: 

#include <stdio.h> 

int main(void)
{
  double exchangeRate, valueDollars, valueCanadian; 
  printf("Enter the exchange rate(1 CA = ? USD): ");
  scanf("%lf", &exchangeRate);
  printf("Enter the value in US dollars: ");
  scanf("%lf", &valueDollars); 
  valueCanadian = valueDollars / exchangeRate; 
  double roundedCad = rint(valueCanadian*100) / 100;
  printf("The value in Canadian dollars is %0.6lf", roundedCad); 
  return 0; 
}
