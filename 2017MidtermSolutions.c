 * Solutions to questions 1 to 10:
 * 1) double y = sqrt((50.0) / (1.0-exp(((-1)*(x))/z))); 
 * 2) int remainderOfThree = (((a%10)+(b%10)+(c%10))/(3.0));  
 * 3) solutions for m values:
 *     m = c = 30
 *     m = -1
 *     m = b = 0
 *     m = c = 1
 * 4) if(a==b && c!=d && e==f) { printf("Are you kidding me????\n"); }
 * 5) 
 *      int main(int argc, char **argv)
        {
            double arr[19] =  {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95}; 
            int randomIndex = rand() % 19; <= This is the ANSWER!
            double randomSelection = arr[randomIndex]; 
            printf("%0.2lf", randomSelection); 
            return 0;
        }
 * 6)  
         int a, b, c, d; 
         int *e, *f;
         a = 5; 
         b = 6;
         e = &c; // e = c
         f = &d; // f = d
       *e = a + b; // e = c = 11
       *f = *e + b; // f = d = 17
         e = &a; // e is now equal to a 
         f = &b; // f is now equal to d
       *e = c + d; // e = 11 + 17 = 28. Remember e points to the address of a, which is no longer 5, but 28. 
       *f = a + b;  // f = 5 + 6 = 11. Remember a is now 28 and not 5, because of the previous statement. 
       
        Thus, the answer is a = 28  and b = 34
 
 * 7) Only one combination would not print success: a = true, b = false and c = false. 
 * 8 - a) Solution: 
         
         int main(void){
         int i = 0; 
         int n  = 10; // Example value!
         while(i < n){ 
            printSomething(i); 
            i++; }
        }
          
 * 8 - b) Solution:
            
         int main(void){
         int i  = 10; // Example value!
         printSomething(i)
         while(i >=0){ 
            i = printSomething(i); 
            }
        }

 //This is solution for question 13:
 
 /* 
      We have to find the first occurence of ECE in an user-inputted string! 
      You have to understand the difference between strstr and strcmp
      In short, strstr is used to compare two string to find the first occurence of the second in the first string.
            => strstr(s1,s2); // It will return NULL if it finds no occurence! 
      In the other hand, strcmp is used to compare two string to see if they are identical. 
      That means if the first character of both string is not same it would not continue to look at the second character.
            => strcmp(s1,s2); // It will return 0 if it finds that both strings are not identical!
      Thus, for this program, it is better and recommended to use strstr if you are not allowed to use arrays!
      
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <string.h>
     
     int main(void)
     {
         char sentence[1000] = "";
         printf("Please enter a sentence: ");
         fgets(sentence, 1000, stdin);
         if (*sentence != '\0') // We know that fgets puts a \0 character in the string. In order to use strtstr properly, we need to remove this \0 character. 
            sentence[strlen(sentence) - 1] = '\0';
         if(strstr(sentence, "ECE") != NULL)
            printf("Found ECE!");
        else
            printf("ECE not found!");

 //This is the solution for question 14: 
  
  /*
    According to the instructions, we need to do the following: 
    
    => Print the total number of values entered; 
    => Print all the values in the order that the user entered them; 
    => Print whether the values are entered in ascending order, i.e., the next value is either greater than or equal to the previous one. 
          For example, {3, 4, 7, 7} is a sequence of values in ascending order, but{3, 4, 7, 6}is not. 
     
    Thus, we would need to use bubble sort to sort through our array (in order to make it in ascending order). 
    We would also need to keep an original copy of our array before the sorting so that we could compare it with the sorted one. 
    We would also need a while loop. 
    To compare both sorted and unsorted arrays, we would need a for loop that will loop through each element of each array to see if they are the same.
    If it finds a element that is not the same as in the other array, it will break and set a value of 0 to the isTrue variable. 
    If it finds that all elements are the same, it will set a value of 1 to the isTrue variable
    We would also need a counter to count the number of index position in the user-inputted array.
