Question 3 [4 Marks]
In most companies, after you write some code, it gets reviewed by other programmers during aso-called “code review” before the code is ever used.  
The purpose of a code review is to makesure the code is well written, concise, understandable and correct.
Joe Wannabe Hacker, who works for FancyCo, submitted the following piece of C code for review:

int i = 0;
do {
  printf("Count: %d\n", i + 1);
  i++;} while (i < 2);

This code was subsequently criticized when code-reviewed. 
Other programmers on the codereview team insisted that the same code could be written in just a single C statement with the C programming language.
Your task is to show that the code review team was right.
In the space below, please provide asingle C statement that has the same outcome as the code submitted by Joe Wannabe Hacker.  
A single C statement contains exactly one terminating semi-colon (‘;’), and does not contain bracebrackets (‘{’or‘}’)

Solution: printf("Count: 1\n Count: 2\n");
