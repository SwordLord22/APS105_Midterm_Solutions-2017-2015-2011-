Question 1 [4 Marks]
Write a single C statement — which contains exactly one terminating semi-colon (‘;’), and does not contain brace brackets (‘{’or‘}’) — that declares a double variable result, and initializes it with the result of computing the following mathematical formula, based on variables x and y:
    
    √((3 sinx)/(1−4e^y))
    
You can assume that all of the functions in the C math library are available,x and y have already been declared as double-type variables, and x is a value in radians (rather than degrees).

Solution: result = sqrt((3*sin(x))/(1-4*exp(y)));
